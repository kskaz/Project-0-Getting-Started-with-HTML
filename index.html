<p><b>Basics of the Web</b></p>

<p>The web is a collection of documents which are made out of <b>HTML</b>. HTML stands
for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>.<br> HTML glues everything (text, videos, images, etc)
together. Documents can contain links to other HTML documents.<br>
This interconnection
of documents gives the Web its name.</p>

<p><b>Major Components of the Web</b></p>

Your computer uses an application called a browser to view HTML documents
that reside on other servers on the Internet.<br>
It uses the HTTP protocol to send and receive
this information.

<p><b>Composition of HTML</b></p>

HTML is made up of:<br>
- <b>text content</b> (what you see)<br>
- <b>markup</b> (determines what it looks like)<br>
- <b>references to other documents</b> (images, videos, etc)<br>
- <b>links</b> to other HTML pages<br>

<p>HTML uses tags to change the appearance of content in a document. They start 
with an opening tag and end with the closing tag.<br> The closing tag shares the
same name as the opening tag but also has a slash in front of the tag's name.<br>
The content being modified by the tag lies between
the opening and closing tag.</p>

Some tags we learned about:<br>
 <b> bold </b><br>
 <em> italics </em><br>

<p><b>HTML attributes</b></p>

<p>HTML attributes are tags that include attributes within them. These attributes
have values.</p> 

Examples are:<br>
<p><b>anchor tag</b> - links to <a href = "www.udacity.com"> another page</a><br>
attribute: href<br>
value: url of page</p>

<p><b>image tag</b> - displays an image on the page<br>
<img src = "http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/03/14/Rix5l.jpg" alt="butterfly"><br>
  attribute: src<br>
  value: location of image<br>
  attribute: alt<br>
  value: text if image doesn't appear</p>

<p>Some tags do not have closing tags if there is no content - the image tag is one of these.</p>

<p><b>Whitespace:</b></p>
<p>In HTML, all whitespace turns into a single space. We use tags to control
how whitespace appears on our page.<br></p>

<p>Example tags:<br>
  <b>br</b> - line break (void tag)<br>
  <b>p</b>  - paragraph - has opening and closing tag - content between tags will
       be contained in the paragraph</p>

<p><b>Block vs Inline</b></p>

<p>Inline tags are just text. Block tags draw invisible boxes around its content
and can have a height and width.</p> 

<p><b>HTML structure</b><br></p>
<p>A complete HTML document includes:<br>
  <b>doctype:</b> type of document<br>
  <b>html tag</b>: at beginning and end of document<br>
  <b>head tag:</b> contains title tag and other meta data (CSS and JavaScript)<br>
  <b>body tag:</b> contains document content</p>

<p><b>We are human but computers are not...</b></p>
<p>Computers can only do what we ask them to do. If we make a mistake in our
programming, unexpected results may occur.<br> If we forget how to do something,
we know we can always look it up. It's impossible to remember everything.</p>
